Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.


This was the best pseudo code practice I've had so far with the challenges. In the past I've either struggled with what to write or there hasn't felt like enough to the code to warrant pseudo. This was genuinely helpful today and made the task at hand easier.
